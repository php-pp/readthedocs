Welcome to PHP++ documentation!
===

`PHP++ <https://github.com/php-pp>`_ is a PHP library with this features:
 * Install only what you need: PHP++ is a set of reusable components
 * Work with objects, do not use functions (example: ``fileatime()`` -> ``FileUtils::getAccessedAt()``)
 * Do not care about ``E_NOTICE`` and it's friends, all PHP errors are catched and replaced by an exception
 * No more problems with parameters position or multiple return types: everything is typed and errors are converted as exception
 * Replace ``array`` by ``Collection`` with only one type allowed (example: ``StringCollection``)

Compatibles PHP versions: from ``7.4`` to the ``latest``.
